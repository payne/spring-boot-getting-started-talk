# Getting started building web applications using Java & Spring Boot

## Abstract: 

Less than 140 characters:
* "Get started with Spring Boot by building an application for sending scheduled tweets. Get started learning about the Spring Boot ecosystem."

A bit more detail:
We'll walk through the steps to get started with Spring Boot by building a 
simple application for sending scheduled tweets.  You'll leave the session understanding how to develop & deploy a Spring Boot application and how to start learning more about the Spring Boot ecosystem.

Plan:
1) Spring boot is an easy button for java web applications.   It's spring framework (1 October 2002) with many things made easier.
2) Build a hello world application and deploy it to Heroku.  Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that has a free tier which does not
require a credit card.
